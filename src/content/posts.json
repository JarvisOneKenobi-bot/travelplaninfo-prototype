They happen because you <strong>booked before you planned</strong>.</p>\n<p>It’s an easy mistake—especially for first-time travelers. You see a flight deal, a “limited time” hotel discount, or a viral reel about a dreamy beach town. You lock something in to “secure it,” and only later realize:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The hotel is far from the neighborhoods you actually want to explore.</li>\n<li>The flight times force an extra night (and extra meals, transfers, and time off work).</li>\n<li>The cheapest fare is non-refundable and doesn’t include a bag.</li>\n<li>The “deal” dates overlap with a festival or school holiday (prices spike everywhere else).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is why understanding <strong>trip planning vs booking</strong> is one of the most money-saving skills you can learn. Planning is where you make smart choices; booking is where you commit money to those choices. When you mix them up, you pay for it—sometimes literally.</p>\n<p>In this guide, you’ll learn the clear difference between the two phases, the optimal sequence (Plan → Book → Confirm), tools that make each phase faster, and a real-world case study showing how planning first can save hundreds.</p>\n<p>> Want an easy version you can follow every time? We’ve included a <strong>downloadable “Plan Before You Book” checklist</strong> you can print or save to your phone.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>1) Introduction: The expensive mistake of booking before planning</h2>\n<p>Booking feels productive. Planning can feel like “just browsing.” But in travel, <strong>productive doesn’t always mean profitable</strong>.</p>\n<p>When you book first, you’re committing to variables you haven’t optimized yet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dates:</strong> Are these the cheapest days to fly? Do they create extra nights you didn’t intend?</li>\n<li><strong>Location:</strong> Is the hotel close to the experiences you want—or just cheap on a map?</li>\n<li><strong>Itinerary fit:</strong> Are you building a trip around one fixed reservation that forces expensive add-ons?</li>\n<li><strong>Budget reality:</strong> Does the “deal” leave enough money for meals, transit, entry fees, and downtime?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Planning first doesn’t mean you’ll never book a deal quickly. It means you’ll have enough clarity (and a simple system) to recognize a real deal versus an expensive trap.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>2) What is trip planning? (research, itinerary, budgeting)</h2>\n<p><strong>Trip planning</strong> is the decision-making phase. It’s where you define what the trip needs to accomplish and how you’ll make it work—before you spend major money.</p>\n<p>Think of planning as building a blueprint. A blueprint doesn’t buy materials; it prevents you from buying the wrong ones.</p>\n<h3>Trip planning typically includes:</h3>\n<p>#### A) Research (the “what” and “where”)</p>\n<p>Research is not endless scrolling. Good research answers specific questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which neighborhood makes sense for my priorities (walkability, safety, nightlife, beach access, museums)?</li>\n<li>What are the must-see activities—and what do they cost?</li>\n<li>What’s the local transportation like (subway, rideshares, parking fees, ferries)?</li>\n<li>What’s the weather and daylight like during my dates?</li>\n<li>Are there peak events or holidays that will raise prices or require advance tickets?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Money-saving payoff:</strong> Research prevents paying for convenience you don’t need (like an overpriced hotel in the wrong area) and helps you avoid hidden costs.</p>\n<p>#### B) Itinerary (the “how” and “when”)</p>\n<p>An itinerary is simply a realistic plan for your days. It doesn’t need to be rigid. The goal is to understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many days you need in each place</li>\n<li>Which areas you’ll spend time in (this controls lodging location)</li>\n<li>Whether you need tours, timed-entry tickets, or reservations</li>\n<li>How long transfers take (including check-in rules, airport time, and jet lag)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Money-saving payoff:</strong> A basic itinerary helps you pick the right base location, avoid extra transit costs, and reduce “oops” nights.</p>\n<p>#### C) Budgeting (the “can we afford this?”)</p>\n<p>A travel budget is more than flights + hotel. Planning includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily food estimate (cheap, mid, splurge)</li>\n<li>Local transit passes or car rental + fuel + tolls + parking</li>\n<li>Attractions and tours</li>\n<li>Tips and fees</li>\n<li>Travel insurance</li>\n<li>Contingency buffer (10–20%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Money-saving payoff:</strong> Budgeting keeps you from “over-booking” the big items and then having to pay premium prices later for essentials.</p>\n<h3>The output of trip planning</h3>\n<p>At the end of planning, you should have:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>A destination + date range</strong> (with flexible options)</p>\n<p>2. <strong>A rough itinerary</strong> (even a simple day-by-day outline)</p>\n<p>3. <strong>A target budget</strong> (and max budget)</p>\n<p>4. <strong>A shortlist</strong> of neighborhoods/hotels and flight time preferences</p>\n<p>5. <strong>A booking strategy</strong> (what to book now vs later)</p>\n<p>Only then does booking become a smart, controlled step.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>3) What is booking? (flights, hotels, activities)</h2>\n<p><strong>Booking</strong> is the purchase-and-reservation phase. It’s where you lock in prices, policies, and commitments.</p>\n<p>When you book, you’re not just paying money—you’re accepting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancellation/refund rules</li>\n<li>Change fees</li>\n<li>Seat/baggage restrictions</li>\n<li>Check-in/out times</li>\n<li>Location trade-offs</li>\n<li>Time constraints for activities</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Booking usually includes:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flights</strong> (or trains/buses)</li>\n<li><strong>Accommodation</strong> (hotels, vacation rentals, hostels)</li>\n<li><strong>Transportation</strong> (car rental, airport transfers)</li>\n<li><strong>Major activities</strong> (tours, timed entry, multi-day passes)</li>\n<li><strong>Travel insurance</strong> (often best purchased soon after key bookings)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Money-saving payoff:</strong> Booking at the right time (and with the right flexibility) helps you capture good prices without painting yourself into a corner.</p>\n<h3>Booking is not the same as “finding deals”</h3>\n<p>A “deal” is only a deal if it matches your planned trip.</p>\n<p>Example: A cheap hotel 45 minutes from everything might cost more once you add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily rideshares or transit tickets</li>\n<li>Extra time (which often becomes extra spending)</li>\n<li>Fewer activities because logistics are tiring</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Planning defines what “good value” means for your specific trip.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>4) The optimal sequence: Plan → Book → Confirm</h2>\n<p>The simplest framework for <strong>trip planning vs booking</strong> is this:</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Plan (decide what you want and what it costs)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose dates (or date ranges)</li>\n<li>Build a rough itinerary</li>\n<li>Choose your base neighborhoods</li>\n<li>Estimate total costs and your daily spend</li>\n<li>Identify what must be reserved early</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 2: Book (commit in the right order)</h3>\n<p>A practical booking order for most trips:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Flights/transport to the destination</strong> (or at least a refundable hold)</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Accommodation</strong> (ideally refundable or with a reasonable cancellation window)</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Key timed activities</strong> (only the ones that sell out or are date-specific)</p>\n<p>4. <strong>Local transport</strong> (car rental, rail passes, airport transfers if needed)</p>\n<p>This order can change depending on your trip (for example, a wedding or a major event may make lodging the #1 priority).</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Confirm (make sure everything works together)</h3>\n<p>Confirmation is the overlooked phase where you prevent expensive last-minute fixes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Re-check your dates, names, and passport details</li>\n<li>Confirm airport/hotel transfer timing</li>\n<li>Save offline copies of confirmations</li>\n<li>Re-read cancellation windows and set calendar reminders</li>\n<li>Make a “Day 1 plan” (arrival, cash/ATM plan, SIM/eSIM, check-in rules)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Money-saving payoff:</strong> Confirming avoids missed check-in windows, non-refundable no-shows, and last-minute rebooking at premium prices.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>5) Tools for each phase (Planning vs. Booking)</h2>\n<p>You’ll save more money with a simple tool stack than with “secret hacks.” Here are practical tools that match each phase.</p>\n<h3>Planning tools (organize research, map logistics, build a budget)</h3>\n<p>#### Google Maps</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create lists for: “Must do,” “Food,” “Neighborhoods,” “Maybe”</li>\n<li>Star your hotel shortlist and major attractions</li>\n<li>Use the <strong>“Nearby”</strong> feature to check what’s walkable</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it saves money:</strong> Location mistakes are expensive. Maps reduce daily transport costs and help you choose a base that fits your itinerary.</p>\n<p>#### Notion (or any notes app)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store links, ideas, and your draft itinerary</li>\n<li>Keep a simple “decision log” (why you chose dates/neighborhoods)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it saves money:</strong> It prevents duplicate bookings, forgotten research, and decision fatigue.</p>\n<p>#### Spreadsheets (Google Sheets / Excel)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a budget with line items and estimated ranges</li>\n<li>Track options side-by-side (Hotel A vs B, Flight 1 vs 2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it saves money:</strong> Spreadsheets make trade-offs visible—like paying $20 more per night to save $15 per day in transit.</p>\n<h3>Booking tools (compare prices, verify policies, lock in the best fit)</h3>\n<p>#### Aggregators (for comparison)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flight search: Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak</li>\n<li>Hotels: Booking.com, Expedia, Hotels.com (varies by region)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How to use them well:</strong> Compare prices and schedules here, then verify details on the provider’s site.</p>\n<p>#### Direct sites (for the final check)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airline site, hotel site, tour operator site</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it saves money:</strong> Direct bookings may offer better cancellation terms, loyalty perks, or fewer “surprise” fees. Even if you still book via an aggregator, checking direct often reveals policy differences.</p>\n<p>#### Price alerts and calendars</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set flight price alerts</li>\n<li>Look at flexible date calendars to spot cheaper departure/return days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why it saves money:</strong> Shifting by one day can cut airfare significantly and can also reduce hotel nights.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>6) Case study: How planning first saved money vs. booking first</h2>\n<p>Let’s compare two versions of a 5-night city trip for two people.</p>\n<h3>Scenario A: Booking first (the common mistake)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You see a hotel deal: <strong>$170/night</strong> in a “good price” area.</li>\n<li>You book it non-refundable because it’s $25/night cheaper.</li>\n<li>Then you pick flights based on those fixed dates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What goes wrong:</strong></p>\n<p>1. The hotel is actually <strong>35–45 minutes</strong> from most attractions.</p>\n<p>2. You end up using rideshares twice per day because the transit route is inconvenient.</p>\n<p>3. Your flight times require an extra late-night meal and an early airport transfer.</p>\n<p><strong>Added costs (conservative estimate):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extra local transport: $18/day x 5 days = <strong>$90</strong></li>\n<li>Two rideshare splurges due to fatigue: $22 x 2 = <strong>$44</strong></li>\n<li>Early airport transfer: <strong>$35</strong></li>\n<li>One extra paid attraction because you “missed” the free museum day: <strong>$40</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Total avoidable costs:</strong> <strong>$209</strong></p>\n<p>And that’s without counting stress and time.</p>\n<h3>Scenario B: Planning first (the money-saving approach)</h3>\n<p>You plan before committing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You map your must-sees and realize you’ll spend most time in two central neighborhoods.</li>\n<li>You create a budget and estimate local transit.</li>\n<li>You check flights with flexible dates and notice leaving one day earlier drops airfare by $120 total.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You book:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A hotel that’s <strong>$190/night</strong> (more expensive at face value) but walkable to most plans.</li>\n<li>Flights on the cheaper date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Savings / cost offsets:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Airfare savings: <strong>$120</strong></li>\n<li>Reduced daily transport (mostly walking + occasional transit): $8/day x 5 = <strong>$40</strong></li>\n<li>No early-transfer surcharge: <strong>$35</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Total savings vs Scenario A:</strong> $120 + ($90 − $40) + $44 + $35 + $40 = <strong>$289</strong></p>\n<p>Even though the planned hotel cost $20 more per night (an extra $100 total), the trip still comes out <strong>about $189 cheaper overall</strong>, with better convenience.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> The cheapest line item isn’t the cheapest trip.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>7) Common booking mistakes (and what they cost)</h2>\n<p>If you want quick wins, avoid these.</p>\n<h3>Mistake #1: Choosing non-refundable too early</h3>\n<p>Non-refundable rates can be fine—<strong>after</strong> your plan is stable.</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden cost:</strong> If you later realize the location/dates are wrong, changing plans becomes expensive or impossible.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix:</strong> When you’re still planning, book refundable (or free cancellation) whenever the price difference is reasonable.</p>\n<h3>Mistake #2: Booking the wrong location because it’s “central” on a map</h3>\n<p>“Central” can be misleading. A river, hill, highway, or transit gap can turn 1 mile into 40 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden cost:</strong> Daily transport + lost time + fatigue spending.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Map your top activities and check commute times at realistic hours.</p>\n<h3>Mistake #3: Ignoring baggage, resort fees, taxes, and deposits</h3>\n<p>A flight that’s $60 cheaper may become $40 more after baggage. A hotel that looks affordable can add nightly resort fees.</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden cost:</strong> The budget you built collapses.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix:</strong> During planning, track “all-in” prices. During booking, re-check checkout totals and fee disclosures.</p>\n<h3>Mistake #4: Booking flights with impossible connection times</h3>\n<p>Short layovers, airport transfers, or last flight of the day are risky.</p>\n<p><strong>Hidden cost:</strong> Missed connections = last-minute rebooking + extra night.</p>\n<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Choose connections you can actually make (especially with checked bags).</p>\n<h3>Mistake #5: Not aligning bookings with your itinerary</h3>\n<p>Booking a hotel for “5 nights” without checking your arrival and departure times can create:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An extra paid night</li>\n<li>A day of luggage storage fees</li>\n<li>A forced early check-in fee</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Confirm check-in/out rules, arrival time, and whether late check-out is possible.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>8) Planning checklist before you book anything</h2>\n<p>Use this as your “pause button” before spending.</p>\n<h3>The essentials (do these first)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ Confirm your <strong>destination</strong> and your top priorities (food, museums, hiking, beaches, nightlife, etc.)</li>\n<li>☐ Decide your <strong>date range</strong> and at least one backup option</li>\n<li>☐ Check seasonality: weather, daylight, peak events, school holidays</li>\n<li>☐ Draft a <strong>rough itinerary</strong> (even just: Day 1 arrival, Day 2 neighborhood A, Day 3 day trip, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Logistics (where money leaks happen)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ Identify the best <strong>home base neighborhood(s)</strong> based on your itinerary</li>\n<li>☐ Estimate local transportation (walking, transit passes, parking)</li>\n<li>☐ Check commute times from hotel areas to your must-sees</li>\n<li>☐ List “must book early” items (popular tours, timed-entry museums, special restaurants)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Budget (make it real)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ Set your target budget + maximum budget</li>\n<li>☐ Estimate food per day (low/mid/high)</li>\n<li>☐ Add line items for attractions, tips, and transit</li>\n<li>☐ Add a 10–20% buffer for surprises</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Booking readiness (green light)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ You know which policies you need (refundable vs non-refundable)</li>\n<li>☐ You’ve compared at least 2–3 flight options and 2–3 lodging options</li>\n<li>☐ You understand total costs (bags, fees, taxes)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Downloadable version:</strong> We recommend saving this checklist as a one-page printout. Travelplaninfo readers can grab the <strong>downloadable “Plan Before You Book” checklist</strong> and use it for every trip.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>9) Recommended planning tools (simple stack for real people)</h2>\n<p>You don’t need 12 apps. Here’s a lean setup that works for most travelers.</p>\n<h3>Option 1: The “Beginner” stack (fast and free)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google Maps</strong> for pins and lists</li>\n<li><strong>Google Docs</strong> for itinerary notes</li>\n<li><strong>Google Sheets</strong> for budget</li>\n<li><strong>Google Flights</strong> for date flexibility and alerts</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Option 2: The “Organized planner” stack</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notion</strong> (or Obsidian/Evernote) as a trip hub</li>\n<li><strong>Spreadsheet</strong> with a cost comparison tab</li>\n<li><strong>Wanderlog</strong> or a similar itinerary app (optional) for day-by-day structure</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Option 3: The “Budget-first” stack</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spreadsheet</strong> as the core</li>\n<li>A separate tab for “per-day budget” and “all-in totals”</li>\n<li>Price alerts for flights and hotels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No matter what you choose, the principle stays the same: <strong>plan with clarity, then book with confidence</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>10) Conclusion: Plan like a pro, book like a saver (plus newsletter signup)</h2>\n<p>The difference between <strong>trip planning vs booking</strong> is simple:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trip planning</strong> is deciding what you want, where you’ll stay, what you’ll do, and what it will cost.</li>\n<li><strong>Booking</strong> is committing money to those decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you book before you plan, you gamble. When you plan first, you control.</p>\n<p>If you want to make this easy, use the Plan → Book → Confirm sequence:</p>\n<p>1. <strong>Plan:</strong> Research, map, budget, draft your itinerary</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Book:</strong> Lock in flights, lodging, and key tickets in a smart order</p>\n<p>3. <strong>Confirm:</strong> Double-check details, policies, and day-one logistics</p>\n<p>Before your next purchase, grab our <strong>downloadable “Plan Before You Book” checklist</strong> and keep it in your phone’s files or travel folder.</p>\n<p>And if you want more money-saving trip strategies—like when to book flights, how to choose neighborhoods, and how to avoid surprise fees—subscribe to the Travelplaninfo newsletter.

If you have a preference as to where you want to stay, you may want to search for resorts first and then choose on a specific vacation destination. This approach can help to maximize the success and pleasure of your vacation, as where you choose to stay can significantly impact your trip.In Jamaica, it is possible to find resorts that have themes. These are themes that cater to specific groups of travelers. Well loved themes for resorts in the Caribbean include family resorts, couples resorts, singles resorts, and adult resorts in general. If you are either taking a family vacation or a romantic getaway, you should examine Jamaica resorts that cater to your wants and needs.As previously stated, many Jamaica resorts are considered all-inclusive resorts. These are resorts that you should first examine. Why? Because they ease the process of plotting a Caribbean vacation. When you pay for your all-inclusive vacation package, you pay for a excellent percentage of your trip upfront, because the cost of your food and drinks should be included as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Costs</strong><br />\nSpeaking of the cost of an all-inclusive vacation package, cost may play a significant role in determining your next Jamaica vacation destination. Some areas of the island may be cheaper to stay at. It will depend on which airport you glide into, which airline you choose, as well as which resort you opt for.</p>\n<p>As stated above, all-inclusive vacation packages often include the cost of your room, entertainment, food, drinks, and tips. For that reason, their costs may seem high. You need to keep this in mind when comparing prices. Traditional vacation packages, which may only include your airline tickets, hotel room, and a car rental, are nice, but they aren’t always the best value for your money.</p>\n<p><strong>Activities</strong><br />\nIf you are looking to step outside of your Jamaica resort or hotel room, you will want to concentrate on nearby activities. Unfortunately, this may not be a determining factor for you. Many of Jamaica’s well loved vacation destinations have similar activities. For example, those located along the beach may all offer swimming, boating, snorkeling, and kayaking.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, land based activities are likely to vary, depending on the terrain in the area. As for land based activities that you may be able to delight in, depending on the location, there is hiking, horseback riding, or taking a jeep tour.</p>\n<p><strong>Attractions</strong><br />\nAside from its warm weather and gorgeous climate, another one of the reasons why Jamaica is a well loved Caribbean vacation destination is because of its attractions. Are you looking to delight in a fun filled day of adventure or would you like to learn more about art and music? Whatever you want, you can find it on the island of Jamaica. But, what you find may vary depending on location.</p>\n<p>For example, if you were to choose Montego Bay Jamaica as your next Caribbean vacation destination, you would find the Aquasol Theme Park, the Bob Marley Experience, and the Greenwood Fantastic House. On the other hand, Negril is home to the Royal Palm Reserve and Rick’s Café, where you can delight in a tasty snack while watching cliff divers. These are just a few of the many attractions and fantastic destinations you will find on this incredible Caribbean island.</p>\n<p>When choosing a Jamaica vacation destination, the above mentioned factors are just a few of the many that you will want to take into consideration. Your choice should depend on your vacation wants, needs, and personal preferences. In all honesty, regardless of where you vacation on the island of Jamaica, you are sure to have the Caribbean vacation of your dreams!</p>\n</div>\n",

This further boosts the possibility of accommodating starters and professional skiers. There are several Fast-four thou sanders surrounding the skiing region. The off-piste and free ride options are roughly legendary already. The Grande Motte (3656m) is undoubtedly the most distinct peak, with its slopes being the highest within the entire skiing region.

What does France have to offer for the party goer? I could, naturally, bring you back to my previous statement:\n\nAnd then, of course, there’s Paris.\n\nBut you know that already. Of course Paris is going to be fun. Like London, Berlin, Warsaw or Amsterdam, we know European Capitals will have everything a traveler needs, but that’s missing the point. France is not Paris and, some would argue, Paris is not France. So where else in this beautiful country can you have a good night out?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-13a7dbd elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"13a7dbd\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>First, I want you to imagine Bordeaux – not the wine, nice as it is, but the city. Bordeaux is not a backwater idyll nestling between rolling hills and vineyards, far from it. The city has a vibrant cafe culture and a night-life that stands up to any other bustling city. And, let’s face it, any town that offers Vinothérapie, or wine spas, has to be top of the bucket list!</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-99eaa6b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"99eaa6b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Next, Lyon. Founded by the Romans, this city is still filled with their legacy. Add to that the fact that the Romans knew how to party, and you also have some of the best night-life in the region. The city also has a reputation as a centre for all things gastronomic, so you can eat some of the best food around in between all those trips to the clubs.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-96d4861 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"96d4861\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Lastly, I want to concentrate on the region of Provence, not just because you will find some of the best food in the world here, but also because it is filled with wonderful cities, cities that like to party as fast and hard as any other in Europe. Take Nice for starters. Nestled on the coast, and not that far from Monte Carlo, Nice is a vibrant city and France’s largest tourist destination.</p><p>Nestled on the Mediterranean, this city has an annual carnival, more shops than you can shake a credit card at, pretty little streets filled with cafes and bistros and, of course, as much night life as you care to enjoy.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-ee8c6fb elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"ee8c6fb\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p> </p><p>There is one city in Provence that has been called the ‘meeting place of the world’, it is, of course, Marseilles. And any city with a reputation like that is going to take care of all your holiday needs. From mountain climbing to cruising (on a boat, naturally) this city has something for everyone. In fact, I would go as far as to say that Marseilles is worthy of a holiday all on its own.</p><p>So, a very quick run through of some French cities you may not have considered as party towns. Get over there, the parties don’t stop just because the season changes. France is an all year round destination with more than enough going on to keep you happy and excited. Why not check out some of the great offers available at the moment for getting to France. Momondo.com, for example, is offering some good savings on airfares at the moment.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1bb2bef elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"1bb2bef\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paris-France-travel-destination-for-newlywed-768x432.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-image-857\" alt=\"Romantic Destination Paris France\" srcset=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paris-France-travel-destination-for-newlywed-768x432.jpg 768w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paris-France-travel-destination-for-newlywed-300x169.jpg 300w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paris-France-travel-destination-for-newlywed-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Paris-France-travel-destination-for-newlywed.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"widget-image-caption wp-caption-text\"></figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Rainwater is not normally acidic, but will acquire this acidity, first by passing through the atmosphere, then and especially by crossing the ground where it is enriched in carbon dioxide. By penetrating the limestone through cracks, they dig cavities of varying sizes and shapes. The dissolved products are evacuated by the circulation of water towards the gorges of the Jonte. The initial cavity, once started, enlarges by successive collapses of its vault to reach its current size 1 million years ago.<br /><br />\n\n\n700,000 years ago , the formation of stalagmites began. When the lime-laden water meets the air in a cavity, carbon dioxide escapes and releases the lime which will remain on the vault of the cavity, forming stalactites. At Aven Armand, the waters are particularly rich in limestone and form very heavy drops which do not stay long enough on the ceiling to form large stalactites. <br /><br />\n.\n\nThe exceptional height of 45 m of the cavity, accelerates the drop rate of the drop. On arriving on the ground, it explodes in innumerable droplets around the point of impact which release their important mineral charge to lead to the formation of a stalagmite. The original shape of the stalagmites comes from this dispersion, reinforced by the deviations in the trajectory of the drops, due to the movements of air in the cavity.<br /><br />\nHIGH MINERAL LOAD, HIGH IMPACT SPEED AND DEVIATION OF THE TRAJECTORIES OF THE DROPS HAVE CREATED A FOREST OF MORE THAN 400 EXCEPTIONAL STALAGMITES, A COLLECTION OF NATURAL SCULPTURES WITH FANTASTIC SHAPES, A UNIQUE HERITAGE IN THE WORLD.<br /><br />\n\n\nFor more practical information about Aven Armand Cave please visit: <a href=\"http://www.aven-armand.com/en-gb/infospratiques.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"

It was built by the Torbay Council and is included in the plans for redevelopment of the seafront area at Princess Gardens. Before the theatre, there was a marquee that was erected on a yearly basis and was home to light entertainment. As anyone who has been to a seaside resort theatre will know, there is usually a Summer Season of shows including variety shows and light entertainment for different age groups.</p><p>However over the years, in addition to the usual fare, there have been 6 week runs of former West End shows such as Chicago, Grease, Blues Brothers Boogie Nights and Jason and His Technicolour Dreamcoat.</p><p>Whatever you fancy doing while visiting the English Riviera, you will never be bored. Even if you just want to take some time out and relax with the sea air and sound of the sea rolling over the sand at one of the many beaches.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f04c51b elementor-widget elementor-widget-video\" data-id=\"f04c51b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-settings=\"{&quot;youtube_url&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/BTHcLPf9ANY&quot;,&quot;video_type&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;,&quot;controls&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;}\" data-widget_type=\"video.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-wrapper elementor-open-inline\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-video\"></div>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

Make the most of caravan parks and Hotels or Resorts that offer kids activity programs so that you can have a bit of a break too.</p><p><strong>Day 1:</strong></p><p><strong>Day 2:</strong></p><p><strong>Day 3</strong>:</p><p><strong>Day 4:</strong></p><p><strong>Day 5:</strong></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section data-particle_enable=\"false\" data-particle-mobile-disabled=\"false\" class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-7621e78 elementor-section-full_width elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"7621e78\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-e-type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-60ef189\" data-id=\"60ef189\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-e-type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-755d84c elementor-icon-list--layout-traditional elementor-list-item-link-full_width elementor-widget elementor-widget-icon-list\" data-id=\"755d84c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"icon-list.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"elementor-icon-list-items\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li class=\"elementor-icon-list-item\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-icon-list-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fas fa-check-square\"></i>\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-icon-list-text\">Step Four | Costs:</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-6414a2e elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"6414a2e\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You can itemize these into the following categories and make an accurate estimation of each.

century, it is a symbol for the West coast of the island and lies by the sea shore and looks absolutely spectacular. Entrance fee per person is around 7 Euros.</p><p>Santa Creu Church – built in a gothic style in 1335 during the reign of Jaime the 2nd, it lies close to La Lonja and surprises through its simple exterior and rich interior.</p><p>The Arab baths – date back to the 10th century, during the Arab domination and have spas and warm floors, interior garden and two bath areas. The price per one ticket is 2 Euros and it is worth it during hot days, when you feel the need for something chill and green. Very intimate and relaxing, especially is you get there during less crowded periods.</p><p>Palma de Mallorca</p><p>Bellver castle – built on the ruins of an Arab site, it was built in the 14th century as a Summer residence for king Jaime the 2nd of Aragon and remained one of the distinct Spanish castles, renowned for its circular shape and its specific architecture. Here you can admire gothic arches sustained by light columns, the imposing chapels around the interior garden and an exhibition of Roman statues found during excavation in the area along with old coins, furniture pieces, ceramics, mosaic and a map of the city of Palma dating in the 13th century.</p><p>After a beautiful period when it was used as a residence for kings, Bellvar was turned into a prison until 1915. Now it serves as the town’s history museum. The price per ticket is 4 Euros per person.</p><p>Almudaina palace – situated in front of <strong><em>La Seu cathedral</em> </strong>on the site of the first Roman establishment in 123 BC, it functioned as an Arab fortress and then, after the Catalan colonization in 1229, it was turned into a royal residence. It is amazing and imposing, closed off by high walls and protected by cannons, with the king court connected to the main entrance, the queen court with an extraordinary column gallery, with 3 well preserved Arab baths (if I remember well) and the throne room. Memorable is the Tower of the heads placed close to Costa de la Seu street where, as the name suggests, prisoner heads were on display…. if you also watch Game of Thrones your imagination will go wild.<br />Entrance fee costs 9 Euros per person and it is worth it.</p><p>There are many other objectives to visit than those stated above, but I promise you that under the Mediterranean sun you will visit the most imposing buildings and then head off for ice-creams, cafes or restaurants, then wonder off with your camera in your hand through the narrow and charming alleys of Palma. Or at least I did that…<br />Advice: go for walks during the weekend and keep the museum visits and shopping during the week days so you will find everything open.</p><p><strong>Palma de Mallorca</strong></p><p>Prices and<em> resorts in Palma de Mallorca</em><br />An ice-cream cup – approx. 1.80 Euros</p><p>A quick lunch with pizza and a beer/or some snacks – approx. 10-12 Euros per person.</p><p>A decent lunch – 25-30 Euros/person</p><p>Souvenirs – obviously, many are kitsch, but you can also find some beautiful things at right prices compared to other resorts. I recommend you make your shopping in <em>Palma de Mallorca</em> or Alcudia – I will come back on this in a future article.</p><p>For the beach buy water and beer from markets – beer costs just like water 1-1,2 Euros.</p><p>Surprisingly decent are the prices in bars on the sea coast or connected to the hotels. For instance an espresso at a bar on the beach or in the centre of the old town of Palma varies between 1.5-1.9 Euros, and at a no name cafe you can get the same quality at 1.2 Euros.</p><p>Usually, the hotels organize shows for those of you that want to go out in the evening and have a drink. A very decent and pleasant mood and so are the bar prices. A good glass of red wine costs 4-5 Euros and a good brandy costs approx 3-3.5 Euros. The price for water and lemon is the same for a glass of brandy.</p><p>Watch out for the terraces with high prices that become even higher when new waves of British and German tourists arrive, you better check the prices before going in.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-44751a1 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"44751a1\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-image-1415\" alt=\"Palma de Mallorca Spain\" srcset=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain.jpg 1280w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-300x117.jpg 300w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-768x300.jpg 768w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-320x125.jpg 320w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-640x250.jpg 640w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-360x141.jpg 360w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-720x281.jpg 720w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-1080x422.jpg 1080w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Palma-de-Mallorca-Spain-800x313.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"widget-image-caption wp-caption-text\">Palma de Mallorca <span style=\"font-size:85%;font-weight: 300\">| Image credits: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/buhoslpr/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Santiago Lopez-Pastor via Flickr</a></span></figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t",

But if it isn&#8217;t, the permit can be purchased at the tourism office across the airport access road (open M-F 08:00-17:00) or at the Waisai Ferry port (open up to half an hour after ferry arrival). The fee is Rp500,000 for Indonesian citizens and Rp1,000,000 for foreigners-you only need a passport as proof of identification, children ages 12 and under are exempt.

Two types of ferries, an express or slow ferry, will get you there in 2 and 4 hours, respectively. As delays may sometimes occur, allow at least 2 hours to connect between the seaport and the airport. Tickets for both sailings can be bought at the wharf and the tourism office.</p><p><em>From Sorong to Waisai</em>, daily ferries depart at 09:00 and 14:00 (Monday to Sunday). From Waisai to Sorong, ferries depart daily (except Saturday) at 09:00 and 14:00. On Saturdays the Waisai to Sorong operates at 09:00 and 12:00. Ferries do not operate on Indonesian public holidays. The journey time is about 2 hours. Ticket prices are Rp120,000 for economy class and Rp240,000 for VIP.</p><p>Speedboats can also be rented at a wharf about 200 meters west of the ferry terminal. While it&#8217;s expensive and less comfortable than a ferry, it can get you there faster.</p><p><em>From Sorong to Fatiga&#8217;s harbor</em> on the island of Misoul, K.M. Fajar Indah goes from Sorong to Misool on Fridays 23:00 and from Misool to Sorong on Saturdays 13:00. K.M.

Local inhabitants in both villages call this phenomenon the &#8220;Sea Ghost&#8221;. This is more than just a sunset view, overlooking from your liveaboard.</p><p>In Tomolo, you&#8217;ll be amazed by the caves in the area, where you can see paintings of huge human palms and animals which were painted by ancient cave dwellers. While on North Waigeo, you can also take in some history with a visit to the World War II caves where the Dutch and the Japanese army built bunkers. The locals will sometimes perform a war dance. There is also the ever-flowing waterfall of Salawati, which is a sight you should not miss.</p><p>You may rent a small boat if you wish to stop and make personal discoveries along the line of the beaches. As the Raja Ampat Islands have four mountainous main islands and hundreds of small islands in their vicinity, you may want to take this opportunity to explore. In addition, the Karst area is a beautiful and original natural phenomenon, as it has various unique flora and fauna as its attractions, e.g., Bird of Paradise (Cenderawasih) Botak, Red Cenderawasih, Maleo Waigeo, Kus-kus, orchids, and palm. You can also trek around the islands to find hidden beauties, like waterfalls and ancient caves.</p><p> </p><p>You can also dive in West Waigeo, Batanta, and Kofiau.

Her beauty is unrivaled and her fame, unwavering. Bora Bora is one of the few places on earth that everyone hopes to witness in their lifetime—and once you see it, you are forever enamored.\n<h4>The Allure</h4>\nMore than just a romantic ideal, Bora Bora is a romantic reality. It comes as no surprise that the island is an internationally acclaimed honeymoon destination. Our newlyweds who decide on a Bora Bora honeymoon often feel as though they have escaped to a private oasis tailored entirely to their special moment of marital bliss—and anyone in the midst of planning a wedding can relate to just how enticing that sounds.\n<h4>The Locale</h4>\nBora Bora may feel worlds away, but this South Seas splendor is well within reach. Where is Bora Bora, exactly? The island lies just northwest of Tahiti, less than an hour away by plane from Papeete. The airport is located on a small, separate part of the island known as Motu Mete. Upon arrival, you will be greeted with a warm smile and fragrant flower lei and transferred by boat to your Bora Bora resort, meaning you hardly have to wait for your first encounter with the island&#8217;s famously translucent lagoon.\n\nThe inevitable love affair with this island begins right before you touch down. The view from the plane window is a moment you will not soon forget. Have your camera in hand as you begin your descent and prepare for the moment when iconic Mount Otemanu comes into view. From that point on, each experience will only continue to exceed even your highest expectations.\n<h4>Accommodation</h4>\nBora Bora has become synonymous with overwater bungalows. Many of these lavish floating villas have glass floors that supply a window to the lagoon life below. This locale is unique in the fact that most Bora Bora resort hotels are built on their own tiny island, or motu, and visits elsewhere must be arranged by boat transfer. Not to worry, though, you will hardly need to leave your bungalow let alone the resort. From lounging on your own private deck and receiving room service via outrigger canoe, to indulging in a rejuvenating spa treatment, you will pass the time in quiet seclusion and opulent luxury.\n<h4>Recreation</h4>\nThe wonderful thing about Bora Bora is that you can be as active or inactive as you wish to be. Should you decide to venture away from the resort, you can visit the main village of Vaitape and shop at the local boutiques or dine at one of Bora Bora&#8217;s restaurants including Mai Kai Bora Bora, or the legendary Bloody Mary&#8217;s. You can also explore Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu on a guided hike or Jeep Safari tour.\n\nSince water is a way of life on the island, popular lagoon excursions include snorkeling, diving, cruising, fishing, paddle boarding, kitesurfing, Jet Skiing, and of course, shark and ray feeding. You can also take your experience to new heights by parasailing, skydiving, or touring the island by helicopter.\n<h4>Final Impression</h4>\nOnce seen, Bora Bora is never forgotten. From the day you arrive until the moment you part ways, you will be in awe of how her soaring mountain peaks, turquoise lagoon and luxuriant overwater bungalows somehow look even more spectacular than the pictures.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e39076b elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"e39076b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/romantic-destination-for-the-newlywed-borabora.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-image-871\" alt=\"romantic destinations for the newlywed - Bora Bora French Polynesia\" srcset=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/romantic-destination-for-the-newlywed-borabora.jpg 1280w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/romantic-destination-for-the-newlywed-borabora-300x141.jpg 300w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/romantic-destination-for-the-newlywed-borabora-768x360.jpg 768w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/romantic-destination-for-the-newlywed-borabora-1024x480.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"widget-image-caption wp-caption-text\">French Polynesia - Bora Bora</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\t<article data-particle_enable=\"false\" data-particle-mobile-disabled=\"false\" class=\"elementor-section elementor-inner-section elementor-element elementor-element-02bd2ef elementor-section-full_width elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"02bd2ef\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-e-type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;shape_divider_top&quot;:&quot;triangle&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-shape elementor-shape-top\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-negative=\"false\">\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 100\" preserveAspectRatio=\"none\">\n\t<path class=\"elementor-shape-fill\" d=\"M500,98.9L0,6.1V0h1000v6.1L500,98.9z\"/>\n</svg>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-inner-column elementor-element elementor-element-ed7d7c3\" data-id=\"ed7d7c3\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-e-type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-109245c elementor-position-inline-start elementor-view-default elementor-mobile-position-block-start elementor-widget elementor-widget-icon-box\" data-id=\"109245c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"icon-box.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-icon-box-wrapper\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-icon-box-icon\">\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/tips-and-tricks-for-getting-the-best-car-rental-deals-online-or-at-location/\" class=\"elementor-icon\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-label=\"Tahiti, French Polynesia\">\n\t\t\t\t<i class=\"fa fa-heart\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-icon-box-content\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-icon-box-title\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/tips-and-tricks-for-getting-the-best-car-rental-deals-online-or-at-location/\" >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTahiti, French Polynesia\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-1f0be0a elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"1f0be0a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Source:</strong> Courtesy of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><a href=\"https://www.tahiti.com/island/bora-bora\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TAHITI.COM</a></em></span></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-00bf69c elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"00bf69c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><style>\nh4 {color:inherit; font-weight: 600;}<br />\n</style></p><h4>Tahiti<br />Queen of the Pacific</h4><p>The heart and soul of the South Pacific, Tahiti is the largest in a chain of islands that make up French Polynesia. The name can either refer to the main island or the entire destination. Commonly referred to as The Islands of Tahiti, French Polynesia is a collection of 118 islands and atolls scattered across an impressive nautical surface area the size of Western Europe. Still, these tiny islands—many of which remain uninhabited—make up a total landmass of only 1,600 square miles (4,100 sq. km).</p><h4>The Locale</h4><p>You may be wondering, where is Tahiti? The islands are situated halfway between Los Angeles, California and Sydney, Australia. They are in the same time zone as Hawaii and located just as far south of the equator as Hawaii is north. Since the word often conjures up visions of a distant, unspoiled paradise, many assume them to be far away; but in all reality, Tahiti is only eight hours from Los Angeles.</p><p>The island of Tahiti is divided into two parts: The larger portion to the northwest is known as Tahiti Nui, while the smaller, southeastern peninsula is known as Tahiti Iti. Tahiti Nui is dominated by three extinct volcanic mountains including Mount Orohena, the tallest in French Polynesia; Mount Aorai, known for its incredible views; and Le Diadème, which appears to crown the island as the rightful queen.</p><p>Home to the capital city of Papeete, Tahiti is the economic center of French Polynesia. Since all flights arrive through Faa&#8217;a International Airport, your tailored Tahiti vacation will begin and end in Papeete. While you may be tempted to jet off immediately to the other islands, we recommend staying at least a day or two. Tahiti strikes an interesting contrast to some of the more quiet, secluded islands in the region; and with a selection of wonderful and convenient Tahiti resorts available, you will never regret staying.</p><h4>The Allure</h4><p>Papeete is a vibrant and multicultural city with busy boulevards and a bustling harbor. The downtown municipal market, Le Marché, is an exciting place to purchase all things Tahiti including vanilla beans, monoi oil and colorful pareos. Just down the street at Le Centre Vaima is the Robert Wan Pearl Museum, which is a great place to start if you&#8217;re hoping to purchase a Tahitian black pearl during your stay. To live like a local, head to Vai&#8217;ete Square after sunset. This waterfront promenade comes to life at night when gourmet food trucks, Les Roulottes, open their windows to serve a range of affordable meals including Chinese food, French crépes, steak frites, fresh fish and pizza.</p><h4>Recreation</h4><p>Beyond the city atmosphere, Tahiti is also a scenic island with lush landscapes and large abounding waterfalls. Leave the more developed areas behind and you will find shady hiking trails, pleasant beaches and calm waters. This unique juxtaposition makes Tahiti one of the most diverse islands in French Polynesia. We recommend exploring these interior peaks and valleys on a guided hike or Jeep Safari tour.</p><p>Other popular activities include snorkeling, Jet Skiing and surfing. Experienced surfers should visit the famed Teahupo&#8217;o and bear witness to one of the world&#8217;s most intense waves. Beginners can surf or take lessons at some of the more mellow beaches around the island. You can also enjoy a day of golfing at the Olivier Bréaud Golf Course, one of only two courses in French Polynesia.</p><h4>Celebration</h4><p>Tahiti really is the hub of all cultural activity. Every July, the annual Heiva I Tahiti transforms the island into a spectacular celebration of Polynesian culture and dance. Year round, you can also catch an authentic Tahitian dance show at the InterContinental Resort every Friday and Saturday night. Permanent historical fixtures include the house of James Norman Hall, Point Venus, the Museum of Tahiti and Her Islands, the Paul Gauguin Museum, and the Harrison Smith Botanical Gardens. These can all be seen on a guided Circle Island Tour, or you can rent a car and explore the island at your leisure.</p><h4>Final Impression</h4><p>Often overlooked by travelers eager to experience the outer islands, Tahiti is more than just a means to an end. How much time you choose to spend here is up to you, but give yourself a chance to see everything the island has to offer—beyond the initial view from the plane.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-757e3ce elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"757e3ce\"

Flying is certainly the quickest way to reach Florida, but it may not be the cheapest.

Even then, you won’t be able to take as much luggage as you’d like or bring back as many souvenirs when you fly.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2c6932dd elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\" data-id=\"2c6932dd\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"divider.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-divider\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-divider-separator\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<article data-particle_enable=\"false\" data-particle-mobile-disabled=\"false\" class=\"elementor-section elementor-inner-section elementor-element elementor-element-3e8bc784 elementor-section-content-top elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"3e8bc784\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-e-type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;shape_divider_top&quot;:&quot;triangle&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-shape elementor-shape-top\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-negative=\"false\">\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 100\" preserveAspectRatio=\"none\">\n\t<path class=\"elementor-shape-fill\" d=\"M500,98.9L0,6.1V0h1000v6.1L500,98.9z\"/>\n</svg>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-inner-column elementor-element elementor-element-2e8a1b8e\" data-id=\"2e8a1b8e\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-e-type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-2da9c7ea elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"2da9c7ea\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-large\"><a href=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/\">BUS OPTION</a></h2>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-3509ef91 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"3509ef91\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you have a few extra days to spare, you may want to consider taking the bus.

First of all, you have to purchase gas. And while gas prices in the U.S. are no longer approaching $4.00 a gallon, it can still be expensive to drive all the way to Florida, especially if you live on the West Coast. Even living in the Mid-U.S. – Texas, for example – you’re still looking at a two or three day drive. During this drive, you’ll need a place to stay, which adds more hotel costs to your trip. However, if you’re willing to stay at budget hotels or take along your camping gear and camp out, you may not have to spend that much money while driving.</p><p>However, you’ll also need to consider the wear and tear on your car if you’re planning a Florida road trip. If your car needs thousands of dollars in maintenance just to make the trip, or if the drive would put you over your mileage limit on your lease, you may want to look at renting a car to get there. Of course, this is yet another expense that you need to consider in your budget. After adding in gas, a rental car, and the extra lodging costs, you may find that it really is cheaper to fly to Florida.

(22 mi) south of Bulawayo, southern Zimbabwe. The hills were formed over 2 billion years ago with granite being forced to the surface, this has eroded to produce smooth \"whaleback dwalas\" and broken kopjes, strewn with boulders and interspersed with thickets of vegetation. Mzilikazi, founder of the Ndebele nation, gave the area its name, meaning 'Bald Heads'.</p>\n\n\n<p>The Hills cover an area of about 3100 km² (1200 sq mi), of which 424 km² (164 sq mi) is National Park, the remainder being largely communal land and a small proportion of commercial farmland. The park extends along the Thuli, Mtshelele, Maleme and Mpopoma river valleys. Part of the national park is set aside as a 100 km² (39 sq mi) game park, which has been stocked with game including the white rhinoceros. \nThe highest point in the hills is the promontory named Gulati (1549 m; 5082 ft) just outside the north-eastern corner of the park.</p>\n\nAdministratively, Matobo National Park incorporates the Lake Matopos Recreational Park, being the area around Hazelside, Sandy Spruit and Lake Matopos.<br />\nThe national park is located within the southern Africa bushveld ecoregion.\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"e-q-footer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<cite class=\"elementor-blockquote__author\">Source: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;font-weight:300\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matobo_National_Park\">Wikipedia</a></span></cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%3Cp%3EThe+Matobo+National+Park+forms+the+core+of+the+Matobo+or+Matopos+Hills%2C+an+area+of+granite+kopjes+and+wooded+valleys+commencing+some+35+kilometres+%2822+mi%29+south+of+Bulawayo%2C+southern+Zimbabwe.+The+hills+were+formed+over+2+billion+years+ago+with+granite+being+forced+to+the+surface%2C+this+has+eroded+to+produce+smooth+%22whaleback+dwalas%22+and+broken+kopjes%2C+strewn+with+boulders+and+interspersed+with+thickets+of+vegetation.+Mzilikazi%2C+founder+of+the+Ndebele+nation%2C+gave+the+area+its+name%2C+meaning+%27Bald+Heads%27.%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%0A%0A%3Cp%3EThe+Hills+cover+an+area+of+about+3100+km%C2%B2+%281200+sq+mi%29%2C+of+which+424+km%C2%B2+%28164+sq+mi%29+is+National+Park%2C+the+remainder+being+largely+communal+land+and+a+small+proportion+of+commercial+farmland.+The+park+extends+along+the+Thuli%2C+Mtshelele%2C+Maleme+and+Mpopoma+river+valleys.+Part+of+the+national+park+is+set+aside+as+a+100+km%C2%B2+%2839+sq+mi%29+game+park%2C+which+has+been+stocked+with+game+including+the+white+rhinoceros.+%0AThe+highest+point+in+the+hills+is+the+promontory+named+Gulati+%281549+m%3B+5082+ft%29+just+outside+the+north-eastern+corner+of+the+park.%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%0AAdministratively%2C+Matobo+National+Park+incorporates+the+Lake+Matopos+Recreational+Park%2C+being+the+area+around+Hazelside%2C+Sandy+Spruit+and+Lake+Matopos.%3Cbr%2F%3E%0AThe+national+park+is+located+within+the+southern+Africa+bushveld+ecoregion.+%E2%80%94+Source%3A+%3Cspan+style%3D%22text-decoration%3A+underline%3B+font-weight%3A300%22%3E%3Ca+href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMatobo_National_Park%22%3EWikipedia%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fspan%3E&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMatobo_National_Park&amp;via=TravelPlanInfo\" class=\"elementor-blockquote__tweet-button\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fab fa-twitter\"></i>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-blockquote__tweet-label\">Tweet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-70281d6 elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\" data-id=\"70281d6\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"divider.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-divider\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-divider-separator\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-97dd113 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"97dd113\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Nswatugi-cave-matobo-national-park-zimbabwe-768x360.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-image-443\" alt=\"Nswatugi Cave painting art -

To see something that few people ever see in a place even fewer people would include in their travel plans.</p><p>If you’re like me and want something a little unusual, might I suggest the Zimbabwe&#8217;s <strong><em>Matobo National Park</em></strong>???</p><p>Most likely, you&#8217;ve never heard of this tourist attraction place. It is indeed in the African country of Zimbabwe.</p><p>Zimbabwe? That’s right. Of course, most people do not think this country is a tourist destination and may be right, but in this case, Matobo National Park was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and it has more than 300 paintings concern mass balanced on rocks surrounded by incredible scenery.</p><p>The best time of year to go is between April and August because it is the dry season when the weather is cool. Sure, you could go in November, when it’s hot (but dry) or late November to March, if you do not mind the rain and humidity of the rainy season.</p><p><em>The Matobo National Park</em> is a mystical place that has a history dating back to about 4 million years. The wind and rain during this period formed the huge granite rocks that you will not see anywhere else. Most rocks hidden caves were sacred places a very long time ago and you can find the amazing rock art in several of these caves, and indeed, this region has the highest concentration of this type of art in Africa.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\t<article data-particle_enable=\"false\" data-particle-mobile-disabled=\"false\" class=\"elementor-section elementor-inner-section elementor-element elementor-element-3c9b7046 elementor-section-full_width elementor-section-content-top elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"3c9b7046\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-e-type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-inner-column elementor-element elementor-element-4cf0e3b2\" data-id=\"4cf0e3b2\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-e-type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-63da4aa elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"63da4aa\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/victoria-falls-zambia-zimbabwe-768x300.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-image-447\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/victoria-falls-zambia-zimbabwe-768x300.jpg 768w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/victoria-falls-zambia-zimbabwe-300x117.jpg 300w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/victoria-falls-zambia-zimbabwe-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/victoria-falls-zambia-zimbabwe.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"widget-image-caption wp-caption-text\">The Victoria Falls, Zambia-Zimbabwe | <span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight: 300\">Image credits: DoctorJoeE via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-46d5e64 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"46d5e64\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>You really have to see it to believe that much art would exist in a place like this.

The pictures are incredibly realistic and detailed to the point where we can identify the species of animals from old photographs.</p><p>The park not only boasts the big rocks, you can be dazzled by the wide variety of rainbow lizards! Tourists can see the Power Rangers of these lizards and it is a sight to see these small shoots under rocks to catch their food and come home.</p><p>Of course, many other animals as well … Zimbabwe is Africa after all. You can see the white rhino, rare color and black and antelope, lots of different monkeys and baboons, and even zebras and leopards!</p><p>I’ll be honest with you, this is not the type of holiday for everyone, but if you are looking for something incredibly unusual and rare, it can get much more spectacular than Matobo National Park in Zimbabwe, Africa.

If you didn&#8217;t take the time to read the company&#8217;s rental agreement/terms of services or didn&#8217;t ask the necessary questions before renting a car, booking a limo service, hotel room, etc, chances are that should you need to litigate any &#8220;failure to disclose&#8221; matter, you will lose arbitration.</p><p><strong>Live Example</strong>: A Yelp reviewer exhausted all arbitration resources (credit card issuer, Consumer Affairs &amp; The BBB) trying to beat a $25.00 cancellation fee from a Car &amp; Limousine service company.<br /> Because the limo service company could prove to all arbitrators involved that the cancellation fee was properly disclosed all over the website, the checkout portal and on the reservation agreement, this person lost all arbitration attempts.

In some cases, if you are renting with a debit card there are certain categories you can’t rent and some documents you will need to bring with you (ex: utility bills, bank statement, etc…).</p><p><strong>Deposits</strong>: Most companies will attach a deposit to your rental price at the time of your booking but will return it to your form of payment when you return the vehicle. The deposit may vary (can be $100-$2500) depending on the type of car category that you’re booking or if it’s a specialty/luxury vehicle.</p><p><strong>Cancellation fees:</strong> I cannot stress enough about really doing your &#8220;Due Diligence&#8221; here and find out all you can regarding cancellation fees. When we are renting a car, booking a hotel room, flight or hiring a limo, we rarely consider that we might need to cancel the reservation for any given reason.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Even after you book, keep shopping. If you didn’t book a nonrefundable rental, you can cancel your reservation if you find a better price.<br /> While most car rental companies don&#8217;t have a cancellation fee (unless you booked with a non-refundable/Pay Now agreement), the hotel and car hire/limousine industry usually have a cancellation policy (It&#8217;s in your interest to know before you commit).</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</article>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-422a1a6 elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\" data-id=\"422a1a6\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"divider.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-divider\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-divider-separator\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-eef6d85 elementor-widget elementor-widget-menu-anchor\" data-id=\"eef6d85\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"menu-anchor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-menu-anchor\" id=\"car-rent-basics\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-4bbeb85 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"4bbeb85\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/car-rental-tips-tricks-travelplaninfo-768x270.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-image-309\" alt=\"car rental tips &amp;

Let them get through their sales pitch and then politely decline. Or even better, add on a couple of extras as it might lead to the offer of a free upgrade and then at the end of the conversation say you changed your mind about the extras. If the agent takes it away now it makes it obvious they’re just after your money and not your convenience (no company wants to make that too obvious).</p><p>• <strong>Letting someone not listed on rental agreement drive</strong> – If someone else is going to drive the rental make sure they are listed on your contract.

If you luggage/cargo is over the airline pre-set limits, chances are you will be charged an overweight fee by the airline at the time of checking-in for your flight (this is not what you need on the final stretch). Make sure to check with your airline in advance in order to avoid unpleasant surprises at the check-in counter if budget is a concern (it&#8217;s not like you have money to burn).</p><p>• Get yourself a <a style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #7a7a7a;\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sr_aj?node=2477391011&amp;ajr=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>suitcase scale</em></a> (you can get a decent scale at Amazon.com for around $10.00).<br /> • If you don&#8217;t have them already, buy quality luggage/suitcases with wheels as they could save you lots of efforts while hauling them and quality issue headaches by not breaking/lasting forever (which means saving money long term).<br /> • Use vacuum-sealed bags you can get at stores like Target, Walmart or Costco to pack and protect your clothes.<br /> • If your bags are overweight, you might find that pre-shipping a box via USPS, FedEx or UPS might be more convenient and cost effective.<br /> • When packing liquids, remember the 3-1-1 liquid rule (check the <a style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: #7a7a7a;\" href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/travel-tips/travel-checklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>TSA&#8217;s Travel Checklist</em></a>).<br /> • Most fluids should be checked in your luggage, do not take in your hand luggage. Ziploc bags are the key to keeping cosmetics, lotions, perfumes and other products organized and sealed.<br /> • Pack your jewelry and wedding rings safely and never place them in the checked luggage. Do always pack these items along with your medications and important documents in your carry-on bag.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section data-particle_enable=\"false\" data-particle-mobile-disabled=\"false\" class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-e5f8476 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"e5f8476\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-e-type=\"section\" data-settings=\"{&quot;shape_divider_top&quot;:&quot;triangle&quot;}\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-shape elementor-shape-top\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-negative=\"false\">\n\t\t\t<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 100\" preserveAspectRatio=\"none\">\n\t<path class=\"elementor-shape-fill\" d=\"M500,98.9L0,6.1V0h1000v6.1L500,98.9z\"/>\n</svg>\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-ba5b24b\" data-id=\"ba5b24b\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-e-type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c3370a1 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"c3370a1\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"wp-caption\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://travelplaninfo.com/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/cloudStorage-pzbyj4quvmp83o0mv858kor70rocu8vu0g798js0aw.png\" title=\"cloudStorage\" alt=\"Secured Cloud Storage\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figcaption class=\"widget-image-caption wp-caption-text\">Keep copies of your  documents in the cloud's secured servers</figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-73abb12 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"73abb12\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-medium\">Safeguarding your documents in the cloud</h3>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-0d991dc elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"0d991dc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Losing or forgetting to take important and sensitive documents can be very overwhelming when you are abroad, therefore, pay particular attention to this task and upload them to a &#8220;secured cloud account&#8221;.</p><p>Take digital pictures or scans of your ID cards, passports and credit of both sides to store these images in a secured storage solution and make sure your mobile devices are password secured and have a &#8220;Find my Phone/Tablet&#8221; app installed just in case you misplace any of them.</p><p>Hope that some of the tips mentioned on this honeymoon checklist prove to be useful for you.

We recommend taking into account the time of year you will be going and looking at the weather, festivals &amp; events that will be on, religious holidays etc in that country. For example, if you go to Canada, do you want to experience their winter and skate on a canal, go skiing or snowboarding, or would you rather go in their summer and camp under the stars and swim in their famous lakes? The time of year you go can completely change your experience of a country and also the activities and places you go there.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section data-particle_enable=\"false\" data-particle-mobile-disabled=\"false\" class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-f22b6e1 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"f22b6e1\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-e-type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-4f10944\" data-id=\"4f10944\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-e-type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e9b8271 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"e9b8271\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Book Travel</h2>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-919815e elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"919815e\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If all of the above is ok, then it is time to book your travel arrangements!

You also run the risk of surge pricing with Uber depending on the time you land. You can always check to see what the local bus and train situation is too. However, with luggage this can be cumbersome. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t<section data-particle_enable=\"false\" data-particle-mobile-disabled=\"false\" class=\"elementor-section elementor-top-section elementor-element elementor-element-7719af9 elementor-section-boxed elementor-section-height-default elementor-section-height-default\" data-id=\"7719af9\" data-element_type=\"section\" data-e-type=\"section\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-container elementor-column-gap-default\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-100 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-0d8dd41\" data-id=\"0d8dd41\" data-element_type=\"column\" data-e-type=\"column\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-wrap elementor-element-populated\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b5b2e9c elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"b5b2e9c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">How to make better use of your time if you are on a business trip</h2>\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-489f464 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"489f464\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you are on a business trip then you want to be as productive as possible and make the most of every minute. If you have to drive yourself around with a rental car, then this is valuable time that you are wasting as you are not only going “A to B” but also then trying to find parking. Just imagine doing this in a city such as New York City, it can be very time consuming and stressful.</p><p>We recommend having someone drive you about when you get to your destination. This removes a lot of the stress of you finding your location each time such as your hotel or office, especially when in a new place.<br /> This then gives you more time to prepare and work before meetings, relax before that all-important presentation and make phone calls without having to worry about being distracted by driving.</p><p>P.S. Do not forget to print a copy of your <b><em>Travel Planning Guidelines</em></b> and make sure to cross check all items you have deemed relevant or important and go over it one more time the day before you embark on your travels. </p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-c47ad3a elementor-widget-divider--view-line elementor-widget elementor-widget-divider\" data-id=\"c47ad3a\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-e-type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"divider.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-divider\">\n\t\t\t<span class=\"elementor-divider-separator\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t",
